# SportsTribution-Scatter
Scatter Plots with names

Problems right now:
Works only on specific Python versions and packages (Python2.7)
Works directly on a Mac, but I needed to change a few things to make it run on a PC (don't know which, sorry...).
setup.py - creates a standalone app with a nice icon ;)
SportsTribution.py - has all the rest...
